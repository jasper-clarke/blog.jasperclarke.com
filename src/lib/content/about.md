# About Me

Hey! I'm **Jasper Clarke**. I've been building websites for the past four years - learned everything myself! I really enjoy creating web solutions that are both powerful and easy to use.

Right now, I'm working at [Cloud Concepts](https://cloudconcepts.com.au) where I get to work with awesome technologies like JavaScript, AWS, and PHP. But I'm always eager to learn new things too, so I'm currently exploring [Gleam](https://gleam.run) and [Golang](https://go.dev)!

My approach to development is all about solving problems and making sure users have a great experience. Linux has been my trusty companion on this journey, helping me become more adaptable and a better problem solver. I also greatly value clean and maintainable code, I'm always looking for ways to improve things through refactoring, rewriting and occasionally, "well I guess it is time to rewrite it in Rust".

Outside of work, you'll find me playing bass guitar or tending to my bonsai trees. Those hobbies have taught me a lot about patience and precision - qualities that definitely come in handy at work! I'm not actively looking for new opportunities right now, but I love connecting with other people in the field, sharing knowledge, and learning from them.

Communication and teamwork are just as important as technical skills to me. Delivering great results is all about collaboration! And of course, finding that balance between work and life is key â€“ I make sure to prioritize both so I can stay refreshed and focused.
